  <b>This Oracle database is designed to manage the entire lifecycle of library operations, including tracking books, authors, library members, loans, and returns. It provides robust features for checking book availability in real-time, managing and calculating fines for overdue items, and generating detailed reports on book popularity and usage trends.</b>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).

<h3>Cloning</h3>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ThiagoRosa21/Database-Library-Management
